# Environment Setup

Links for how to setup the development environment and the dependencies needed for the project.

Development Environment <dev_environment>
Needed Dependencies <dependencies_needed>
Guide on how to run Webots simulation  <webots_how_to_guide>
```

Once you have this set up, I'd then recommend starting to read the {doc}`../drl_pkg` and attempting to run a few of the launch files to get a feel for how the simulation and the code works.

After playing around with that code, please visit the {doc}`../where_i_left/where_i_left` to see the current state of the project and the direction it needs to head.
